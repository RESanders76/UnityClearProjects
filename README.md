This tool was used to clear the project list for Unity 4 and maybe "5". It clears the registry keys. It is for Windows only. 
We have abandoned this tool, but maybe someone can find a renewed use for it. 

It is VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY rough. It was thrown together just enough to run and perform the task we needed LOL. 

Have fun, and if you use this, give us a shout out, and let us know what you did with this.
